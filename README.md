# StatsProject
* This repository includes a stats project that I did in the fall semester of 2022
* My group and I collected data about how people felt about the transportation on campus
* We then did statistical analysis using JMP and made observations based on the patterns and trends we saw
* Attached is the Final Report and our presentation
